# Kry FullStack Architecture Workshop

## Kvitter

We are starting a brand-new company to provide a new cat-themed micro-blogging service.
We have hired 2 developers (including you) to build our first version.

We have the following requirements and goals:
- Write a post
- See posts from someone
- Follow someone
- Home screen: see posts from people you follow
- Search

Please draw a prospective architecture for such a system.

You should address the following:
- security
- data storage
- scalability
- availability

You can use the cloud provider of your choice.

### Purpose

With this excercise we are hoping to assess your understanding of web architectures and patterns
as well as how you analyse complex and competing requirements.
